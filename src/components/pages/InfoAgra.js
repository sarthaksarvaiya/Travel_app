              The <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is an icon of India, drawing
              millions of tourists to the city of Agra every year. This
              breathtaking landmark is every bit as incredible as you've
              imagined. But while most travelers might be eager to escape Agra's
              pushy touts and exhausting crowds as soon as they've left the Taj
              Mahal, you should consider sticking around a bit longer.

                You've seen it in history books, on postcards, and in social
                media posts. But now, you've made your way to India, and you
                finally have the chance to see the Taj Mahal in real life.
              </p>
              <p>
                The magnificent structure dates back to the 17th century. Mughal
                emperor Shah Jahan was heartbroken after his beloved wife,
                Mumtaz Mahal, passed away during childbirth, and decided to pay
                tribute to her with a white mausoleum. Construction took more
                than 20 years to complete and required the manpower of around
                20,000 laborers.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's never a bad time to see the Taj Mahal, but it's worth
                getting here early&mdash;the building seems to radiate at
                sunrise. Tourists can enter the UNESCO World Heritage Site via
                the <strong>west and east gates. </strong>Once inside, explore
                the <strong>ornamental gardens, </strong>which feature calming
                water features that reflect the Taj. Then, head inside the Taj
                itself and admire its perfect symmetry and white marble with
                elaborate floral cavings and semiprecious stone inlays.

                The <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> isn't the only UNESCO World
                Heritage Site in Agra&mdash;the city is also home to Agra Fort,
                a centuries-old red sandstone fortress that was once the
                imperial city for a succession of Mughal rulers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sightseeing here is like wandering around a city within a city.
                The most extraordinary building at Agra Fort is{" "}
                <strong>Jahangir Mahal</strong>, a massive palace that blends
                stunning Hindu-inspired features (like overhanging enclosed
                balconies) with Central Asian architectural elements (such as
                the signature pointed arches). Inside, tourists can see the
                gilded <strong>central court </strong>where royal women once
                passed their days.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tourists can also check out a range of other noteworthy
                structures, including <strong>Anguri Bagh </strong>(a courtyard
                with puzzle piece-like outlines of gardens around water
                channels), <strong>Khas Mahal </strong>(a palace with pavilions
                made of white marble and red sandstone),{" "}
                <strong>Musamman Burj </strong>(an octagonal tower with
                intricate marble inlay work), and <strong>Diwan-i-Khas </strong>

              </p>
              <p>
                With so much to see, Agra Fort will require at least a few hours

                On the banks of the <strong>Yamuna River</strong> sits another
                one of Agra's exquisite structures: Itimad-ud-Daulah's Tomb. The
                mausoleum contains the remains of Mirza Ghiyas Beg, a Persian
                official who served the Mughal empire, as well as his wife.
              </p>
              <p>
                Legend has it that this jewelry box-like tomb was actually the
                inspiration for the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong>, earning it the
                nickname "Baby Taj." The red sandstone and marble structure
                features 13-meter-high hexagonal towers on each corner.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most noteworthy thing about this attraction, though, is that
                it was the first structure to use <strong>pietra dura</strong>,
                the iconic Indian inlay technique that uses semiprecious stones
                to create decorative floral designs in marble. You'll see
                exquisite geometric patterns, depictions of vases and cups, and
                delicate flower bouquets from floor to ceiling of the graceful
                structure&mdash;reminiscent of those on the Taj Mahal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite its beauty, Itimad-ud-Daulah's Tomb gets far fewer
                visitors than other attractions around Agra, making it an ideal
                place to appreciate the lovely features without the crowds.

                For nearly 50 years, emperor Akbar the Great ruled the Mughal
                kingdom, tripling its empire to include most of the northern
                half of the Indian subcontinent. His remains (along with those
                of two of his daughters) can be found at what is now one of the
                most popular tourist attractions in Agra, Akbar's Mausoleum.
              </p>
              <p>
                The complex features a marvelous sandstone and marble tomb with
                striking marble inlay in a variety of colors. The structure is
                surrounded by <strong>Mughal gardens </strong>that are home to

                Just an hour's drive from the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong>,
                Fatehpur Sikri makes for a worthwhile day trip from Agra. The
                city, once the capital of the Mughal Empire some 500 years ago,
                was built by Akbar as a salute to the famous Sufi saint, Shaikh
                Salim Chishti, who accurately predicted the birth of an heir.
                Residents abandoned the city not long after it was built, when
                water supplies ran too low.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tourists can now explore the well-preserved remains of this red
                sandstone ghost town, still surrounded by a fortification wall.
                Check out the <strong>Jama Masjid</strong>, a mosque and one of
                the first buildings finished in the city. Then, explore the{" "}
                <strong>three palaces</strong>, built for each one of Akbar's
                wives. They combine a variety of religious-inspired
                architectural styles that honor the women's individual
                spiritualities.

                Finally, get off the beaten path and stroll to{" "}
                <strong>Hiran Minar</strong>, a circular spiked tower covered
                with stone elephant tusks, atop which Akbar himself supposedly
                gazed at wildlife.

                including grey ware pot shreds, terra-cotta lamps, mini human
                heads in stone, jewelry molds, and much more.

                Between its reverence for cows and its temples dedicated to
                specific creatures, India has a fascinating relationship with
                animals. But not every tradition has been kind to four-legged
                creatures. Case in point: Dancing sloth bears.
              </p>
              <p>
                For thousands of years, India's Kalandar community has poached
                sloth bear cubs, driven a red hot poker and coarse rope through
                their muzzles and yanked on the string to force them to put on
                painful "performances" for a paying audience. India prohibited
                the cruel practice in 1972. However, the mistreatment
                continued&mdash;leaving animal rights activists, such as{" "}
                <strong>Wildlife SOS</strong>, to save the victimized bears.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can see around 200 of these rescued dancing bears at Agra
                Bear Rescue Center. It opens the facility to tourists for three
                two-hour sessions each day, which include a guided tour; a
                documentary screening on rescue efforts; and a chance to see the
                bears playing, foraging, and climbing trees. It's a heartwarming
                experience, and all proceeds go toward rehabilitation efforts.

                Sloth bears aren't the only focus for{" "}
                <strong>Wildlife SOS</strong>&mdash;the animal protection
                organization also takes care of abused elephants at a sanctuary
                just 30 kilometers outside of Agra. On tours of the facility,
                you can see around 20 rescued elephants that were forced to work
                in harsh conditions. Lucky tourists may even be invited to help
                prepare lunch for the tusked mammals.

                While you will definitely have other opportunities to interact
                with elephants on your trip to India, visiting the Elephant
                Conservation and Care Center is by far one of the most ethical
                (and fulfilling) ways to get up close to these special
