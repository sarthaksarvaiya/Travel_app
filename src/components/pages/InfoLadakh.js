            The essence of Ladakh lies in its scenic beauty and monasteries.
            While there are a number of monasteries in the valley, you can lodge
            yourself at the Lamauru, Thiksey or Hemis Monastery for a night.
            These are some of the biggest monasteries in Ladakh, and have proper
            arrangements for accommodating tourists. Get a closer look at the
            minimalistic life of Lamas, follow their disciplined routine, get
            inspired by their extremely polite demeanour and expose yourself to
            a way of life you&rsquo;ve never known. These monasteries offer you
            a unique experience, which can leave an everlasting impact on your
            entire personality and lifestyle.

          <h1> Relax at the Chumathang Hot Springs </h1>
          <p>
            The high altitude and rugged terrain
            of&nbsp;Ladakh&nbsp;is&nbsp;certainly not a cakewalk for occasional
            visitors. Besides, it can get very tiresome and challenging if you
            have been exploring the place on foot. Stop by
            the&nbsp;Chumathang&nbsp;Village to soak your body and spirit in the
            natural hot springs of the Indus River. The warmth of
            these&nbsp;sulphur-water&nbsp;springs is a natural cure for altitude
            sickness and comes as a relaxing break in the middle of a long,
            taxing drive. You can also&nbsp;savour&nbsp;some simple local food
            at the&nbsp;<em>dhabas</em>&nbsp;lined up near the springs.

          <h1> Visit the Turtuk Village</h1>
          <p>
            A fragment of the popular &lsquo;Silk Route&rsquo;, Turtuk Village
            is one the lesser-explored villages of Ladakh located near the
            Indo-Pakistan Border. The village opened its gates to tourists in
            2010, and has a majority of Muslim population as it was re-captured
            by the Indian Army from Pakistan in 1971. The cultural richness
            unspoilt by commercial tourism, and the soulful landscape makes a
            visit to this village absolutely delightful. Located 160 kms from
            Leh, Turtuk is a low altitude village (3000 mts above sea level)
            primarily inhabited by the Balti tribals. Fields full of wheat crop,
            a lingering fragrance of apricots in the air, and rhythmic sounds of
            river water offer a truly soulful treat to the senses. It takes 2
            hours to reach Turtuk from Nubra Valley.
