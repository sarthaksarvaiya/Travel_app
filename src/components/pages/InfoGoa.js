              sand, and smooth azure surf that promises to soothe the stresses
              of traveling in India. And at just an hour and 15 minutes away by

                Dona Paula Beach is one of the best beaches in Goa for honeymoon
                tourists. Nicknamed <strong>"Lovers' Paradise,"</strong> this
                coastal destination in the suburbs of Panaji even has its own l

              </p>
              <p>
                The tale is about Dona Paula, the daughter of a Portuguese
                viceroy, who threw herself into the Arabian Sea after her father
                forbade her from seeing a Goan fisherman who had stolen her
                heart. The viceroy was so saddened by the loss of his young
                daughter that he named this entire beautiful area after her, and
                treated it as a tribute to eternal romance.

                This beach in north Goa offers a more wild, rustic feel than
                others in the state. It's a tranquil escape, lined with beach
                huts and sun beds, where you can spend hours on end. Morjim
                Beach has earned the nickname "Little Russia" for the large
                influx of Russians who stay here for weeks at a time. Its
                abundance of Russian restaurants can be a welcome change of pace
                from the rest of the food in Goa.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the top things to do in Morjim Beach is check out the
                wildlife. A variety of feathered species, including kingfishers,
                cuckoos, bay-backed shrikes, and sand plovers, create a{" "}

                <strong>Olive ridley sea turtles </strong>can be found along the
                beach and offer unique photo opportunities. However, local laws
                prohibit tourists from disturbing the creatures, so be
                respectful and avoid getting too close. Look out to sea and you
                may see <strong>dolphins</strong> swimming along the horizon.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Hot tip: </strong>Bring your best pair of binoculars, so
                you can get up-close views of the animals at Morjim Beach.

                Arambol was once an untouched fishing village, but backpackers
                have since transformed it into a mecca for free spirits. You
                could spend your day here lounging on the beach and enjoying the
                sea. However, most tourists enhance their itineraries with tons
                of soulful things to do at Arambol Beach. You can practice{" "}

                Arambol Beach also rivals Agonda when it comes to the

                international surf school in Goa, offers lessons for groups and
                individuals that range from one to five days. Surf Wala also

                Candolim Beach offers that classic stretch of sand lined by
                beach shacks and caf&eacute;s that every tourist in Goa is
                looking for. Nearby <strong>Baga Beach</strong> tends to attract
                more crowds, which leaves Candolim Beach delightfully less
                boisterous, and spectacularly beautiful. It's an inviting place
                with just the right amount of development to keep visitors
                comfortable and entertained.
              </p>
              <p>
                Plan to spend one full day at Candolim Beach. It'll give you
                time to see the ocean fade into different shades of blue, gray,
                and white throughout the day. Plus, it's one of the best places
                to <strong>watch the sunset in Goa</strong>. Snag your perfect
                spot and watch as the sky explodes into a rainbow of colors.
