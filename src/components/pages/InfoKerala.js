                get a first hand feel of the unhurried pace of life in the
                remote hamlets. Alappuzha is always known for backwaters. A
                houseboat cruise at Alappuzha backwaters is a refreshing
                experience.

                The demand for medical treatment and surgery in Kerala is
                increasing especially in the gulf and Europe. The NRIs who
                prefer treatment in their home country, are playing a
                significant role in this regard. Several MNCs offer medical
                treatment options to employees and families at cost effective
                rates. What with soaring health care costs and long waits for
                medical procedures in the West, it is becoming increasingly
                difficult to find quality, affordable treatment there. India and
                especially Kerala is emerging as a major medical tourism
                destination.
