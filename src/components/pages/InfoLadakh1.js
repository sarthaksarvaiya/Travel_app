            . Spend two days acclimatizing to the altitude. The thin air can
            take a little getting used to so don&rsquo;t rush it. Take your time
            and adjust to your surroundings so you can be on top of your game to
            enjoy the days ahead.

            While in Leh, take time out to see Leh Palace. Once the royal
            residence, the Leh Palace built on the Namgyal Peak is being
            restored by the Archeological Survey of India. Visitors can get a
            glimpse into past glory at the Palace Museum, which houses a
            collection of thangkas, jewellery and ceremonial dresses.&nbsp;

            Cities have high rises. Ladakh has monasteries. Artistically dotting
            the landscape, some of the stupas and gompas date back centuries to
            tell tales of Buddhist culture and history. Worth a visit are Diskit
            Monastery with a statue of the Crowned Buddha along with several
            murals and frescos, Thiksey Monastery, which is the largest gompa in
            central Ladakh housing a 49-foot high statue of Maitreya Buddha and
            Hemis Monastery dedicated to Guru Padmasambhava. The famous Hemis
            Festival is held here where cham or{" "}

            hand painted thangkas and ancient armoury.&nbsp;

            Pangong Lake or Pangong Tso makes for a picture perfect excursion.
            At a height of over 14,200&nbsp;feet, Pangong Lake&rsquo;s 134
            kilometre&nbsp;stretches from India to China. Getting to Pangong
            Lake is about a five-hour drive from Leh town and once you arrive,
            you&rsquo;re likely to never want to leave.

          <p>
            Another visual treat is Tso Moriri. Its clear blue glacial waters
            mirror the surrounding mountains down to every detail. The largest
            high altitude lake in the trans-Himalayan region, entirely within
            India, Tso Moriri and the Tso Moriri Wetland Conservation Reserve is
            home to several species of flora, fauna and wildlife unique to
            Ladakh.&nbsp;

            It&rsquo;s only fitting that when you&rsquo;re the &ldquo;land of
            high passes&rdquo; that you make your way to them. On the
            eastern&nbsp;Pir Panjal Range&nbsp;of the Himalayas spanning 50
            kilometres, Rohtang La connects the&nbsp;Kullu Valley&nbsp;with
            the&nbsp;Lahaul and Spiti&nbsp;Valleys. Somewhat treacherous to
            traverse in the winter when the area is cloaked in snow, Rohtang La
            comes alive in the summer and don&rsquo;t be surprised if
            you&rsquo;re stuck in a traffic jam!

            At over 17,500 feet, Ladakh is home to Khardung La, the highest
            motorable pass in the world. Located to the north of&nbsp;

            , it&rsquo;s the gateway to the&nbsp;Shyok&nbsp;and&nbsp;Nubra
            valleys, the latter of which is also home to the Siachen Glacier.
            The 39-kilometre long Khardung La will have you at the edge of your
            seats with a part of the road being paved and the rest being rocky
            and gravel laden.
          </p>
          <p>
            Take a deep breath and let the spiritual serenity in Ladakh take
            over your senses. It&rsquo;s unlikely you&rsquo;ll experience
            anything like it anywhere else in the world.{" "}
